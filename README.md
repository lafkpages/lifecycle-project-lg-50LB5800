# Lifecycle of an LG 50LB5800 Smart TV

This project investigates the lifecycle of an LG 50LB5800 Smart TV from 2014, examining its production, use, and disposal. Using FreeCAD, an open-source CAD software, a detailed 3D model of the television was created and 3D printed at 15% scale. The production inquiry reveals that this specific model was assembled at LG's Mława plant in Poland, with key components like tin and gold sourced from Polish suppliers Fenix Metals and KGHM Polska Miedź. The research explores ethical concerns around conflict minerals in TV manufacturing and LG's policies to address these issues. A custom Google Maps visualization tracks the product's journey from raw material extraction to final disposal. The television's 10-year lifespan aligns with industry averages, though its disposal highlights ongoing challenges in electronics recycling, with Spain currently recycling only 35% of e-waste compared to the EU's 50% target for 2025. The project concludes by examining the environmental impact of e-waste and the need for manufacturers to take greater responsibility for product end-of-life management.
